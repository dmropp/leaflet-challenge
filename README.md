# leaflet-challenge

README for the leaflet challenge. All references are commented in the relevent line of code.

The purpose of this project is to map all earthquakes from the past month utilizing Leaflet.js and data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that is updated every minute. The map has the following features:

- Markers placed at the locaation of each earthquake.
- The size of marker is relative to the magnitude of the earthquake.
- The color of the marker illustrates the depth of the earthquake in km (as defined in the map legend).
- Each marker has a popup that displays the location of the earthquake, the magnitude, and the depth.
