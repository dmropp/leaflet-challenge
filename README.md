- Markers placed at the locaation of each earthquake.
- The size of marker is relative to the magnitude of the earthquake.
- The color of the marker illustrates the depth of the earthquake in km (as defined in the map legend).
- Each marker has a popup that displays the location of the earthquake, the magnitude, and the depth.
